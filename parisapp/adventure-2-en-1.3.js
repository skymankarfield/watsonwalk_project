To encourage digital access among scholars and non-scholars alike, the EMiC team has built an augmented reality smartphone application called &quot;WatsonWalk.&quot; Our goal has been to digitize relevant archival materials from the 1955-56 academic year, a turbulent period in Wilfred and Sheila's marriage, and a year that they spent in Paris. With a marriage in crisis and pressing career decisions to be made, Sheila's anxieties manifested themselves in long walks across the ancient city, which she logged in her daily journals. &quot;Because the sun shone and the wind blew,&quot; she wrote in her journal on 11 January 1956, &quot;I walked my fear into the cobble stones of Paris.&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nWatsonWalk allows you to walk in Sheila's Paris footsteps. WatsonWalk guides you along the same routes that Sheila took, leading you to specific landmarks where your phone or tablet will display relevant materials from the archives: passages about that particular site drawn from Sheila's letters and journals, photos of the Watsons in those very same places, artworks they saw in galleries, sketches they made from cafes and park benches, as well as period photos from the late 1950s that help to resurrect the cobblestoned streets and bustling neighbourhoods of Paris more than a half century ago. Mobile computing makes tangible and real the kinds of projects that, until now, only a few privileged scholars have had the opportunity of pursuing. It brings the archive back to the streets where those selfsame materials originated."},"parameters":{"version":{"individualValue":"1.3","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"languages":{"containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","textContent":{"en":"English","fr":"French"},"valuesSet":["en"]},"directoryFiles":{"individualValue":"parisapp","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"pathways":{"containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","textContent":{"webService":"Default directions","localDatabase":"The Watson's way"},"valuesSet":["webService"]},"unlockedPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_2.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"startActivePathway":{"individualValue":"webService","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"nextPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_3.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"lockedPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_1.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"lockedPath":{"individualValue":"#FF0000","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"unlockedPath":{"individualValue":"#00FF00","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"defaultOfflineMapID":{"individualValue":"5","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"versionDictionary":{"individualValue":"1.0","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"adventureID":{"individualValue":"2","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"URLRepository":{"individualValue":"http:\/\/javakafe.com\/location-based_App","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"workOnline":{"individualValue":"0","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"startWithTutorial":{"individualValue":"1","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"defaultLanguage":{"individualValue":"en","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"mobileAPIKey":{"individualValue":"c9e76f10a0ef4265a615d0ea30c0b799","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"tokenURL":{"individualValue":"http:\/\/auth.cloudmade.com\/token","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"shareMessage":{"individualValue":"@emic_ua #WatsonWalk http:\/\/bit.ly\/NHycYf","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"}},"sections":{"tutorial":{"section_ID":"3","tag":"tutorial","sectionKey":"tutorial","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","containsParameters":"0","containsMediaInfo":"0","textContent":{"pageContent":"Welcome to the Watson Walk mobile app!&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;This app will guide you along two walks recorded in the detailed Paris journals of Canadian author Sheila Watson. Sheila and her husband, Wilfred Watson, lived in Paris from September 1955 to August 1956. While Wilfred worked on early drafts of his play &lt;i&gt;Cockrow and the Gulls&lt;\/i&gt;, Sheila explored the streets of Paris, revised her novel &lt;i&gt;The Double Hook&lt;\/i&gt;, and completed her short-story &quot;Antigone.&quot; A productive year for both, Sheila''s journals often hint at the turbulence that constantly threatened her and Wilfred''s relationship. As she notes in her October 1 entry, &quot;There are things I would write, but can''t. Could one write a history of love systematically destroye--.&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Sheila''s journals contain richly detailed accounts of the people and places that she saw, as well as careful reflections on the simple triumphs and struggles of daily lives playing out on ancient streets. Scenes, impressions, and themes from these journals echo throughout Sheila''s later literary work. By revealing the connections between the places that Sheila visited and her journals and literature, this app recasts all three, explicitly drawing them together in an intuitive mobile environment.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each of the two Walks featured here is plotted on several detailed maps. These maps are the central navigational node of the app; everything you need to follow in Sheila''s footsteps is available from the map screen.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The app will guide you along each wal--showing your route on the map, detecting your location, telling you which streets to follow, and identifying various Points of Interest (POIs). Tapping the map at any point brings up a simple navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. This navigation bar contains several options: [Home], [Walks], [POIs], [Map] and [Share]. Tap the map again to hide the navigation bar.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The [Home] button takes you to the [Home] screen, where you can read more about the project and make changes to the app''s settings.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Walks] button takes you to a list of the walks, which provides information about what you will see and learn on each walk, as well as its length. From here, you can also read the entire journal entries that these walks are based on.&lt;br \/&gt;The [POIs] button takes you to a list of all the Points of Interest.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Map] button will take you to the map.  The app contains two map--a current navigation map and a map from the 1950--and you can switch between them by swiping your finger across the map. You can also switch between generic directions (provided by a navigation web service) and customized directions written by our team.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Share] button links directly to your Twitter account, allowing you to tweet about the incredible locations and rich layers of scholarly information that you''ll discover on these walks!&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each walk traverses various Points Of Interest that Sheila mentions in her journal entries. These POIs include some of the most famous places in Paris and they are the backbone of the walks.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each POI contains several Media Items--passages from Sheila''s journals, excerpts from her literary texts, images of the POIs from the 1950s, and more. While samples of these Media Items are always available, for some POIs the most interesting information will only be unlocked once you take a walk and visit the various Points! Only by following in Sheila''s footsteps will you gain access to the rich collection of archival material contained in the app!&lt;br \/&gt;Swiping your finger across the screen at each POI allows you to scroll through the multiple Media Items associated with that Point; tap the [&quot;i&quot;] icon to view each Item''s caption and source.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;All of the data required to experience Sheila''s walks was delivered to your mobile device when you downloaded the app, so there is no need to keep your expensive data plan running while you explore the mid-''50s Paris that helped shape the Watsons'' writing.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Enjoy!","titlePage":"Story &amp; How-To"}},"about":{"section_ID":"4","tag":"about","sectionKey":"about","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","containsParameters":"0","containsMediaInfo":"0","textContent":{"pageContent":"&lt;em&gt;WatsonWalk: The Paris Journals of Sheila Watson&lt;\/em&gt; was created by the Editing Modernism in Canada research group at the University of Alberta.

Recently arrived in Paris, Wilfred and Sheila Watson walk from their apartment to the Museum of Modern Art after Sheila attends morning mass for the first time in twenty years. The gospel that &quot;no man can serve two masters; or either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will sustain the one and despise the other&quot; reverberates through Sheila's meditations on the dichotomies of art and religion, man and wife, tourist and native. Her vision paints the walk as secondary and the destination as supreme: the walk becomes both a way into the city and entirely irrelevant. Clarity comes through observed moments of patience and routine.","descriptionLong":"Today is September 4.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I have been thinking a great deal.  This morning I went to eleven o'clock mass at the Madeleine.  When I came back W. said it was the 14 Sunday after Pentecost.  This is the first time I have been to mass for more than twenty years.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The gospel for the Sunday, Matthew 6: At that time Jesus said to his disciples: No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will sustain the one and despise the other.  You cannot serve God and Mammon.  Therefore I say to you, be not solicitous for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on.  Is not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?  Behold the birds of the air &amp;mdash;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;&amp;mdash; a sea of faces &amp;mdash; old women and men in Toulouse&amp;mdash;Lautrec clothing &amp;mdash; young women &amp;mdash; a few children &amp;mdash; a Spaniard next to me who sang the credo in a loud voice &amp;mdash; very old priests in ugly vestments &amp;mdash; a great disturbance collecting the cinq francs &amp;mdash; the offering: Benissez &amp;mdash; an old crooked woman in black collected for &quot;les pauvres&quot; &amp;mdash; then the priest in the pulpit reading the gospel. Yet the church was full of people turning towards God &amp;mdash; curious tourists too no doubt, but people from everywhere telling their beads and bowing their heads when the priest elevated the host &amp;mdash; people crossing their foreheads their lips and their hearts &amp;mdash; people bowing quietly to the priest as he passed during the asperg&egrave;s.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;W said he thought the sign &quot;pi&eacute;tons&quot; indicated a pilgrim's way &amp;mdash; Chaucer would agree.  Man the eternal pedestrian.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The &quot;ascenseur&quot; here is like a bird cage suspended between the cobbled court and the 5i&egrave;m etage. Every time I get into it I think how frail the cord moves in space. Yet one trusts that it will reach the fifth floor.  The other day as I was carried slowly past the 3i&egrave;m a man lifted his hat as he passed in the hall.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;In the afternoon we walked down the Rue Royal through the Place de la Concord and through the gardens of the Petit Palace and the Grand Palace.  The trees are turning in the parks Children were riding donkies but the black goat harnessed in a little cart stood idle and inquiring.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;At the door of the Museum of Modern Art we were greeted by the monstrous rolling nude of Maliol In a whole gallery there is always so little at a time &amp;mdash; today the Utrillo's &amp;mdash; two Braques the Modigliani sketch for a caryatid &amp;mdash; Miro's lion &amp;mdash; Henry More's figure on the stairs going down to the salle de sculpture.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Between the Ave. Montaigne &amp; the Champs Elysee is an attractive street Rue Jean Gougon &amp;mdash; on the east side of Av. Fr. D. Roosevelt it becomes the Av. De Selves.  On it there is an Armenian chappel and a small Church of Our Lady of Consolation &amp;mdash; We sat looking out at the Eiffel Tower and drank coffee. A woman with a dog sat at the table next to us. The dog wanted sugar from our table.  It sat in its chair politely staring at the sugar until she asked for a piece.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;It is a quarter to two and the baby across the court is coughing and whimpering a little in its sleep.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The images of Matisse and Picasso and Braque and Utrillo &amp;mdash; of Matisse are everywhere &amp;mdash; the blue black sky and the moving clouds above the chimney pots &amp;mdash; windows and people in windows&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Tomorrow the laundress comes with the &quot;demi souple&quot; shirts&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Somehow tonight I can't sleep &amp;mdash; W's misery cuts across my heart.

heavy then slit with blue sunlight.&quot; Sheila Watson takes a meandering post-Christmas walk, winding around the &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; and &Icirc;le Saint-Louis, always within sight of the river and the silhouette of Notre Dame. Even on dry land, this walk is infused with the spirit of the water: a woman carries a gold fish; a tackle shop sells double hooks. She walks here without specific destination. Her observations are sharp, concisely illustrated and open a window into the world of Paris at the turn of the year.","descriptionLong":"This morning I read the notice of Andr&eacute; Daumain's death posted on the door of the market &amp;mdash; The father was cutting up meat his face read and swollen with weeping.  Maurice has inherited Andr&eacute;'s work. He moves about outside the shop &amp;mdash; cautiously and sadly important&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;This afternoon the Seine was alive with barges &amp;mdash; the Paulain a small tug off on its own &amp;mdash; the Dorogne, a long blue shell towing three dinghys &amp;mdash; the Jupiter towing the Agadir, the Aveyron and another nameless barge.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The wind was blowing and the Seine was cold gold &amp;mdash; the sky grey and heavy then slit with blue sunlight Children off to the gardens with sailboats under their arms &amp;mdash; On the way to the Pont Neuf I went down the r. Richelieu and for the first time noticed Moli&egrave;re with his two muses at the angle of his street and the cardinals.  On the Quai du Louvre a woman &amp;mdash; pulled into the wind which was blowing from the Eiffel tower by a wire haired terrier &amp;mdash; carefully managed a large goldfish in a plastic bag.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;At the shop which sells fishing tackle (Q. De L'Horloge) I bought two double hooks (hame&ccedil;ons doubles) for good luck.  A black and white spaniel puppy was tied up at the back of the shop in a dog jungle of hanging boxes &amp;mdash; Here one could get a fish basket like the ones the men on the river banks use &amp;mdash; wire &amp;mdash; or the long necked net bags hooped with willow or bamboo of some kind &amp;mdash;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;At the Hotel Dieu a hearse was picking up a body &amp;mdash;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Just beyond on the Quai des Fleurs the merchants were selling their bulbs and bushes &amp;mdash; the flower market itself flames with azelas, hyacinths and tulips in pots, red and white and yellow and golden pink ranunculus &amp;mdash; I walked down the narrow r. Des Ursines and followed a boy and girl who were pushing a baby in a carriage up the even narrower r. Des Chantres to the r. Des Chanionesse The r. Des Chantres with its gray flat walls is a Utrillo street &amp;mdash; so narrow that a pi&eacute;ton has to flatten against the buildings to let a car pass.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;From the end of the Quai des Fleurs the Pt. St. Louis leads across to the other island.  Because it was after four I made only a brief investigation along the Q. D'Orleans, down the r. Le Regrattier &amp;mdash; the Q. Bourbon Just on the other side of the Pont Marie marked with its crumbling pink stone plaque I came upon the first open pissoir that I have seen in Paris &amp;mdash; I had thought that people were unduly squeamish about the feet and the overcoat hems which one sees in places like the Bd Haussman. On the far side of the bridge a truck coming round the corner hit the back end of another truck and threw it up on the narrow pavement &amp;mdash; tumbled crates and broken bottles, but apparently no more serious damage.  Then the shouting and name calling began.  A young man in a black corduroy jacket closed a neat window in the Hotel de la Paix &amp;mdash; then, sitting down at his desk, picked up his pen again.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;I walked back past the Editions Erasme around the Pl. St. Louis and down the r. Cloitre N-D past the gargoyls.  A group of students was just preparing to go up into the tower &amp;mdash; another hearse with a wreath pinned on the side waited outside the door of the church.  At the end of the r. De Lutece the spire of the St. Chapelle was gold against the gray sky.  The holiday has brought a new invasion of tourists, both English and French.  By the time I got back to the Madeleine end of the Capucines the sky at the end of the r. Cambon was purple with dusk &amp;mdash; Across on the Bd Madeleine a man had set up a camelot.  He was surrounded with children and loiterers but I had not time left to stop\r\n&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;W. said tonight that all people live in the imagination and that men write real poetry only when they break through imagination into reality.&lt;br \/&gt;I can see what he means relative to himself &amp;mdash;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 75%; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;For research purposes only.

His collection, which went to the Petit Palais in 1953, included over four hundred paintings and drawings.... It was sufficiently important to become the catalyst for the city of Paris to expand the gallery space for its collections by renovating the Palais de Tokyo and opening there in 1961 the Mus&eacute;e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, to which the Giradin collection was moved and where it remains (see &lt;a href=&quot;www.paris.fr\/collection&quot;&gt;www.paris.fr\/collection&lt;\/a&gt; for history; consulted February 8 2012).&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size: 75%; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; This information courtesy of Shirley Neuman and Fred Flahiff, eds., &lt;em&gt;The Journals of Sheila Watson&lt;\/em&gt;, ms. in preparation.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt; Image from &lt;em&gt;Paris en Images&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;br\/&gt; &copy; Roger Henrard \/ Mus&eacute;e Carnavalet \/ Roger-Viollet\n&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.parisenimages.fr\/en\/popup-photo.html?photo=27152-15&quot;&gt;http:\/\/www.parisenimages.fr\/en\/popup-photo.html?photo=27152-15&lt;\/a&gt;\n&lt;\/p&gt;"}},{"tag":"photo2","containsMediaContent":"1","containsTextContent":"1","mediaContent":{"photo":{"value":"http:\/\/javakafe.com\/location-based_App\/parisapp\/src\/img\/4\/02_img023-(glasses).png","fileType":"img"}},"textContent":{"footnote":"From Sheila Watson's sketchbook","description":"On September 18th, Sheila Watson writes:&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On Wednesday Mme Gouzien took me to Les Invalides...
