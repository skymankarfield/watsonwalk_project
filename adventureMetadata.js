To encourage digital access among scholars and non-scholars alike, the EMiC team has built an augmented reality smartphone application called &quot;WatsonWalk.&quot; Our goal has been to digitize relevant archival materials from the 1955-56 academic year, a turbulent period in Wilfred and Sheila's marriage, and a year that they spent in Paris. With a marriage in crisis and pressing career decisions to be made, Sheila's anxieties manifested themselves in long walks across the ancient city, which she logged in her daily journals. &quot;Because the sun shone and the wind blew,&quot; she wrote in her journal on 11 January 1956, &quot;I walked my fear into the cobble stones of Paris.&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;\r\nWatsonWalk allows you to walk in Sheila's Paris footsteps. WatsonWalk guides you along the same routes that Sheila took, leading you to specific landmarks where your phone or tablet will display relevant materials from the archives: passages about that particular site drawn from Sheila's letters and journals, photos of the Watsons in those very same places, artworks they saw in galleries, sketches they made from cafes and park benches, as well as period photos from the late 1950s that help to resurrect the cobblestoned streets and bustling neighbourhoods of Paris more than a half century ago. Mobile computing makes tangible and real the kinds of projects that, until now, only a few privileged scholars have had the opportunity of pursuing. It brings the archive back to the streets where those selfsame materials originated."},"parameters":{"version":{"individualValue":"1.3","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"languages":{"containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","textContent":{"en":"English","fr":"French"},"valuesSet":["en"]},"directoryFiles":{"individualValue":"parisapp","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"pathways":{"containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","textContent":{"webService":"Default directions","localDatabase":"The Watson's way"},"valuesSet":["webService"]},"unlockedPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_2.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"startActivePathway":{"individualValue":"webService","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"nextPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_3.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"lockedPOI":{"individualValue":"marker_1.png","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"lockedPath":{"individualValue":"#FF0000","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"unlockedPath":{"individualValue":"#00FF00","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"defaultOfflineMapID":{"individualValue":"5","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"versionDictionary":{"individualValue":"1.0","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"adventureID":{"individualValue":"2","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"URLRepository":{"individualValue":"http:\/\/javakafe.com\/location-based_App","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"workOnline":{"individualValue":"0","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"startWithTutorial":{"individualValue":"1","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"defaultLanguage":{"individualValue":"en","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"mobileAPIKey":{"individualValue":"c9e76f10a0ef4265a615d0ea30c0b799","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"tokenURL":{"individualValue":"http:\/\/auth.cloudmade.com\/token","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"},"shareMessage":{"individualValue":"@emic_ua #WatsonWalk http:\/\/bit.ly\/NHycYf","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"0"}},"sections":{"tutorial":{"section_ID":"3","tag":"tutorial","sectionKey":"tutorial","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","containsParameters":"0","containsMediaInfo":"0","textContent":{"pageContent":"Welcome to the Watson Walk mobile app!&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;This app will guide you along two walks recorded in the detailed Paris journals of Canadian author Sheila Watson. Sheila and her husband, Wilfred Watson, lived in Paris from September 1955 to August 1956. While Wilfred worked on early drafts of his play &lt;i&gt;Cockrow and the Gulls&lt;\/i&gt;, Sheila explored the streets of Paris, revised her novel &lt;i&gt;The Double Hook&lt;\/i&gt;, and completed her short-story &quot;Antigone.&quot; A productive year for both, Sheila''s journals often hint at the turbulence that constantly threatened her and Wilfred''s relationship. As she notes in her October 1 entry, &quot;There are things I would write, but can''t. Could one write a history of love systematically destroye--.&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Sheila''s journals contain richly detailed accounts of the people and places that she saw, as well as careful reflections on the simple triumphs and struggles of daily lives playing out on ancient streets. Scenes, impressions, and themes from these journals echo throughout Sheila''s later literary work. By revealing the connections between the places that Sheila visited and her journals and literature, this app recasts all three, explicitly drawing them together in an intuitive mobile environment.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each of the two Walks featured here is plotted on several detailed maps. These maps are the central navigational node of the app; everything you need to follow in Sheila''s footsteps is available from the map screen.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The app will guide you along each wal--showing your route on the map, detecting your location, telling you which streets to follow, and identifying various Points of Interest (POIs). Tapping the map at any point brings up a simple navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. This navigation bar contains several options: [Home], [Walks], [POIs], [Map] and [Share]. Tap the map again to hide the navigation bar.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;The [Home] button takes you to the [Home] screen, where you can read more about the project and make changes to the app''s settings.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Walks] button takes you to a list of the walks, which provides information about what you will see and learn on each walk, as well as its length. From here, you can also read the entire journal entries that these walks are based on.&lt;br \/&gt;The [POIs] button takes you to a list of all the Points of Interest.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Map] button will take you to the map.  The app contains two map--a current navigation map and a map from the 1950--and you can switch between them by swiping your finger across the map. You can also switch between generic directions (provided by a navigation web service) and customized directions written by our team.&lt;br \/&gt;The [Share] button links directly to your Twitter account, allowing you to tweet about the incredible locations and rich layers of scholarly information that you''ll discover on these walks!&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each walk traverses various Points Of Interest that Sheila mentions in her journal entries. These POIs include some of the most famous places in Paris and they are the backbone of the walks.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Each POI contains several Media Items--passages from Sheila''s journals, excerpts from her literary texts, images of the POIs from the 1950s, and more. While samples of these Media Items are always available, for some POIs the most interesting information will only be unlocked once you take a walk and visit the various Points! Only by following in Sheila''s footsteps will you gain access to the rich collection of archival material contained in the app!&lt;br \/&gt;Swiping your finger across the screen at each POI allows you to scroll through the multiple Media Items associated with that Point; tap the [&quot;i&quot;] icon to view each Item''s caption and source.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;All of the data required to experience Sheila''s walks was delivered to your mobile device when you downloaded the app, so there is no need to keep your expensive data plan running while you explore the mid-''50s Paris that helped shape the Watsons'' writing.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt;Enjoy!","titlePage":"Story &amp; How-To"}},"about":{"section_ID":"4","tag":"about","sectionKey":"about","containsMediaContent":"0","containsTextContent":"1","containsParameters":"0","containsMediaInfo":"0","textContent":{"pageContent":"&lt;em&gt;WatsonWalk: The Paris Journals of Sheila Watson&lt;\/em&gt; was created by the Editing Modernism in Canada research group at the University of Alberta.
